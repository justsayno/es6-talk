# Deconstructing

This one of the most exciting features and lets you take an object and break it up into its parts while
assigning them to new localally scoped variables. This is easier to understand by example:

```
var person = {
    name: 'john',
    role: 'developer',
    company: 'Google'
}

let { name, role, company } = person
console.log(name) // john
console.log(role) // developer
console.log(company) // Google
```

This is also very useful when importing ES6 modules as well (which I have not covered yet) becuase you can get just the part of a 
module you want rather than the whole library:

```
import { Component } from 'angular';
```
