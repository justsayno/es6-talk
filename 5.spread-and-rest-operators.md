# Spread Operator

The spread operator lets you take an array and 'spread' it out into its values. A really good example of that
is if you are trying to remove an item in an array without altering the original array i.e. immutability.

```
let oldArray = [10,11,12]

let newArray = [
    ...state.channelConnections.slice(0, 1),
    ...state.channelConnections.slice(2),
]

console.log(oldArray); // [10,11,12]
console.log(newArray); //[10, 12]
```

This might look slightly confusing but all we are doing is taking the first 0-1 items and then taking all items after 2 and using
the `...` spread operator to combine the two arrays into one again.

# Rest operator

This is almost the opposite and works in a similar way to `params` in c#. If you have a function where you want to pass an
indetermned number of parameters to it then you can do this:

```
function someFunction(productId, ...catagories){
    console.log(catagories);
}

console.log(someFunction(1, 'cars'));
console.log(someFunction(1, 'sports', 'rugby'));
console.log(someFunction(1, 'politics', 'news', 'current events'));
```

This essentially turns all the paremeters after the first one into an array for you.
