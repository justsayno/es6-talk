# Arrow functions

Arrow functions are much like lambas in languages such as C# and look like this:

```
/**
 * Old way
 */
setTimeout(function(){ 
    console.log('Regular callback:')
    console.log(this)
}, 1);

/**
 * Arrow function
 */
setTimeout(() => { 
    console.log('Arrow function:')
    console.log(this)
}, 1);
```

I have used the above example to show how these "fat arrow functions" don't only save some typing but they help with the use of the 'this' keyword. In the first example 
if you ran it in Chrome you would get 

```
#document
```

Because the click event handler will return the object you are acting on.

If you run the second example you get:

```
Window{}
```

Because `this` is not highjacked by the click even handler and instead remains the same `this` as it is in the scope you created the arrow funcion, in this case 
the window object.
