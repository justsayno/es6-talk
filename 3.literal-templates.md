# Literal templates

This feature exists in other languages such as c# and is a much more simple
way to build strings from varibles and split strings into multiple lines.

You have to use the backtick character and surround variables with ${}:

``` javascript
let name = 'seth'
let message = `Hi ${seth}`
```
