# New Variable declaration

ES6 provides some great new ways to declare variables that can help avoid
a lot of hte issues that have occured with traditional `var` declaration.

## Let and block scoping

Now we can use the `let` keyword which both scopes a variable to the current block
as well as not `hoisting` variables. For example:

``` javascript
let variable1 = 1;
for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) { 
    console.log(variable1)
}

let variable2 = 1;
for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) { 
    variable2 = 2
    console.log(variable)
}


for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) { 
    console.log(variable3)
}
let variable3 = 1;
```

## Constants

We can also create constants within a block scope that are not allowed to be
changed once declared. You also are not allowed to create a constant without
giving it a value:

``` javascript
let variable1 = 1;
for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) { 
    console.log(variable1)
}

let variable2 = 1;
for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) { 
    variable2 = 2
    console.log(variable)
}

for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) { 
    console.log(variable3)
}
let variable3 = 1;

/**
 * Constants
 */

const CONSTANT1 = 1

// the following is not allowed!
// CONSTANT1 = 2
// CONSTANT;

let CONSTANT1 = 1;
for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    // block scoped so it is allowed! 
    const CONSTANT1 = 2
    console.log(CONSTANT1)
}

```
